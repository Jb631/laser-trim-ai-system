# Historical Page Analytics Fix Summary

## Overview
Fixed all broken data summary and analytics features on the Historical Data page that were not working due to data structure mismatches and missing method calls.

## Issues Identified
1. **Analytics dashboard metrics were never being updated** - The `_update_dashboard_metrics()` method was defined but never called
2. **Data structure mismatch** - Analytics methods expected specific column names that weren't present in the raw database results
3. **Missing data preparation** - Raw database results needed to be transformed into analytics-friendly format
4. **Analytics buttons used wrong data** - Trend analysis, correlation analysis, etc. were using raw data instead of prepared data

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Added Analytics Data Preparation
Created `_prepare_and_update_analytics()` method that:
- Converts raw database results to analytics-friendly format
- Extracts track-level data (sigma gradient, linearity error, risk category)
- Averages values across multiple tracks
- Stores prepared data in `self._analytics_data` for reuse

### 2. Connected Dashboard Metrics
- Added call to `_prepare_and_update_analytics()` when data is loaded
- Dashboard metrics now update automatically after queries
- All metric cards show appropriate values and colors

### 3. Fixed Analytics Methods
Updated all analytics methods to use prepared data:
- `_run_trend_analysis()` - Now uses `self._analytics_data`
- `_run_correlation_analysis()` - Now uses `self._analytics_data`
- `_generate_statistical_summary()` - Now uses `self._analytics_data`
- `_run_predictive_analysis()` - Now uses `self._analytics_data`

### 4. Enhanced Dashboard Metrics
- **Total Records**: Shows count of analyzed files
- **Pass Rate**: Calculates and displays with color coding (green >95%, orange 85-95%, red <85%)
- **Trend Direction**: Analyzes recent sigma gradient trends (Improving/Stable/Declining)
- **Sigma Correlation**: Shows correlation between sigma and linearity error
- **Linearity Stability**: Calculates coefficient of variation as stability metric
- **Quality Score**: Composite metric based on pass rate and stability
- **Anomalies Detected**: Uses z-score method to detect outliers (>3 standard deviations)
- **Prediction Accuracy**: Placeholder until predictive models are run

### 5. Data Structure Mapping
Raw database results are now properly mapped:
```python
{
    'overall_status': 'PASS' or 'FAIL',
    'sigma_gradient': average from tracks,
    'linearity_error': average from tracks,
    'risk_category': worst case from tracks,
    'timestamp': from result timestamp or file_date
}
```

## Benefits
1. **All analytics features now work** - Dashboard updates, trend analysis, correlations, etc.
2. **Consistent data handling** - Single source of truth for analytics data
3. **Better error handling** - Graceful fallbacks for missing data
4. **Improved user experience** - Real-time metrics update after queries

## Testing Recommendations
1. Run a database query and verify all dashboard metrics update
2. Click each analytics button and verify they produce results
3. Test with different data sets to ensure calculations are correct
4. Verify color coding changes appropriately based on values

## Future Improvements
1. Add real-time prediction accuracy updates when ML models are used
2. Implement more sophisticated anomaly detection algorithms
3. Add configurable thresholds for metric color coding
4. Cache analytics results for better performance
