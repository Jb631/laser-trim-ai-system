## Work Log

### Infrastructure Creation

**Status**: âœ… Complete

**Actions Taken**:
1. Created REFACTORING/ directory structure:
   - PHASES/phase-1-foundation through phase-6-testing
   - SESSIONS/ directory for session logs
   - ARCHIVE/ for completed phases
   - IDEAS.md for future improvements

2. Created core tracking files:
   - README.md - Master index with 6-phase overview
   - CLAUDE_REFACTOR_RULES.md - 10 strict refactoring rules
   - SESSION_PROTOCOL.md - Mandatory start/end checklists
   - PROGRESS.md - Overall project progress tracking
   - MEASUREMENTS.md - Performance benchmark tracking
   - DECISIONS.md - ADR log with 6 initial decisions
   - RISKS.md - Risk register with 7 active risks

3. Created session template:
   - SESSIONS/template.md - Comprehensive session log template

4. Created Phase 1 files:
   - PHASES/phase-1-foundation/CHECKLIST.md (5 days, 25 tasks)
   - PHASES/phase-1-foundation/PROGRESS.md
   - PHASES/phase-1-foundation/NOTES.md
   - PHASES/phase-1-foundation/RESULTS.md

**Results**:
- Complete tracking infrastructure ready for Phase 1 execution
- 15+ files created with comprehensive templates
- All ADRs documented (3 accepted, 3 proposed)
- 7 active risks identified with mitigation strategies

**Notes**:
- Infrastructure follows user's requirement: "extremely organized with tracking and strict claude rules"
- Session protocol includes mandatory 5-10 minute start/end checklists
- Commit format strictly defined: `[PHASE-X.Y] CATEGORY: Description`
- Feature flags planned for all major architectural changes

### Next Session
**Start With**: Phase 1, Day 1, Task 1.1: Review refactoring plan and rules

**Prerequisites**:
- Infrastructure committed to git
- CLAUDE.md updated with refactoring section
- Create git branch: `refactor/phase-1-foundation`

**Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours (Day 1 has 7 tasks)

### Notes & Observations

**What Went Well**:
- Comprehensive infrastructure created efficiently
- All tracking mechanisms in place
- Clear session protocol established
- User requirements fully captured (organized, strict rules, tracking)

**What Could Be Better**:
- N/A - first session went smoothly

**Learnings**:
- User wants "extremely organized" approach - infrastructure reflects this
- Strict commit format enforced: `[PHASE-X.Y] CATEGORY: Description`
- Feature flags required for all major changes (ADR-001)
- Session protocol includes 30-minute progress checks for long sessions

**Ideas for Future Phases**:
- (Tracked in REFACTORING/IDEAS.md when they arise)
