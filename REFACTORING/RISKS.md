# Risk Register & Mitigation Strategies

**Purpose**: Track all known risks, issues, and mitigation strategies during refactoring

---

## Risk Categories

- 🔴 **High**: Could block progress or cause data loss
- 🟡 **Medium**: Could delay timeline or cause temporary issues
- 🟢 **Low**: Minor impact, easily resolved

---

## Active Risks

### RISK-001: Breaking Existing Functionality
**Category**: 🔴 High
**Probability**: Medium
**Impact**: High - Users cannot process files

**Description**: Aggressive refactoring could break existing workflows without realizing it

**Mitigation Strategies**:
1. ✅ Run full test suite before/after every change
2. ✅ Use feature flags for major changes (can disable if broken)
3. ✅ Maintain backward compatibility (deprecated but working)
4. ✅ Manual smoke testing after each phase
5. ⏸️ Create integration test suite (Phase 6)

**Monitoring**:
- Test pass rate (must stay 100%)
- User reports (if deployed)

**Recovery Plan**:
- Feature flag OFF → revert to old behavior
- Git rollback to last known good commit
- Stash changes and fix in isolated branch

**Status**: Active (mitigations in place)

### RISK-002: Performance Regression on Large Batches
**Category**: 🟡 Medium
**Probability**: Medium
**Impact**: Medium - Processing slower than before

**Description**: Unified processor or ML integration could be slower than current optimized paths

**Mitigation Strategies**:
1. ✅ Benchmark after every performance-related change
2. ✅ Set performance targets (1000 files <5 min)
3. ⏸️ Profile before/after major changes
4. ⏸️ Add performance tests to test suite

**Monitoring**:
- MEASUREMENTS.md tracking
- Benchmark script results

**Recovery Plan**:
- Identify bottleneck via profiling
- Optimize critical path
- If unfixable: revert change, try different approach

**Status**: Active (benchmarking in place)

---

### RISK-003: Lost Work Due to Session Interruption
**Category**: 🟢 Low
**Probability**: Medium
**Impact**: Low - Lost time, not lost code (git stash available)

**Description**: Session interrupted before commit, work not saved properly

**Mitigation Strategies**:
1. ✅ SESSION_PROTOCOL.md emergency end procedure
2. ✅ Git stash with clear messages
3. ✅ Session logs document where to resume
4. Commit frequently (every complete subtask)

**Monitoring**:
- Session logs completeness
- Git stash list

**Recovery Plan**:
- Check git stash list
- Review last session log
- Decide: continue or rollback stash

**Status**: Active (protocol in place)

---

### RISK-004: Scope Creep - Adding Features During Refactoring
**Category**: 🟡 Medium
**Probability**: High
**Impact**: Medium - Timeline delay, increased complexity

**Description**: Temptation to add new features or "fix while you're there" during refactoring

**Mitigation Strategies**:
1. ✅ CLAUDE_REFACTOR_RULES.md Rule 8: No Scope Creep
2. ✅ REFACTORING/IDEAS.md for future improvements
3. ✅ Strict adherence to phase checklists
4. ⏸️ Code review to catch scope creep

**Monitoring**:
- Commit messages (should match phase tasks)
- Session logs (should align with checklist)

**Recovery Plan**:
- Identify non-refactoring work
- Move to IDEAS.md or separate branch
- Refocus on phase checklist

**Status**: Active (rules in place)

---

### RISK-005: Database Migration Issues
**Category**: 🔴 High
**Probability**: Low
**Impact**: High - Could corrupt production database

**Description**: Adding `processed_files` table or other schema changes could fail

**Mitigation Strategies**:
1. ✅ Test migrations on development database first
2. ✅ Backup database before migration
3. ⏸️ Create rollback migration script
4. ⏸️ Test with production data copy

**Monitoring**:
- Migration script success logs
- Database integrity checks

**Recovery Plan**:
- Run rollback migration
- Restore from backup
- Fix migration script and retry

**Status**: Active (will be critical in Phase 1, Day 2)

---

### RISK-006: ML Model Training Data Insufficient
**Category**: 🟡 Medium
**Probability**: Medium
**Impact**: Medium - ML models less accurate than formulas

**Description**: Not enough historical data to train accurate ML models

**Mitigation Strategies**:
1. ✅ Formula fallback always available
2. ⏸️ Check data quantity before training (min 500 samples)
3. ⏸️ Validate ML accuracy vs formulas
4. ⏸️ Document minimum data requirements

**Monitoring**:
- ML model performance metrics
- Comparison to formula-based predictions

**Recovery Plan**:
- Continue using formula-based predictions
- Collect more data
- Retrain models when sufficient data available

**Status**: Active (will be critical in Phase 3)

---

### RISK-007: Test Suite Becomes Too Slow
**Category**: 🟢 Low
**Probability**: Medium
**Impact**: Low - Slower development iteration

**Description**: Adding many regression tests could make test suite slow

**Mitigation Strategies**:
1. ✅ Measure test suite execution time
2. ⏸️ Use pytest markers for slow tests (run separately)
3. ⏸️ Optimize slow tests
4. ⏸️ Parallel test execution

**Monitoring**:
- pytest --durations=10 output
- MEASUREMENTS.md test suite timing

**Recovery Plan**:
- Identify slow tests
- Optimize or mark as slow
- Run slow tests separately in CI

**Status**: Active (monitoring in place)
