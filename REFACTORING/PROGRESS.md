## Metrics Tracking

### Code Reduction
- **Target**: -6,000 lines (-8% of total)
- **Current**: 0 lines (0%)
- **Remaining**: 6,000 lines

**Breakdown by Phase:**
- Phase 1: -1,052 lines (AnalyticsEngine removal)
- Phase 2: -1,000 lines (processor unification)
- Phase 4: -3,500 lines (file splitting, reducing duplication)
- Phase 5: -448 lines (GUI consolidation)

### Performance Improvements
**Baseline (To be established in Phase 1, Day 1):**
- 100 files: TBD seconds (TBD ms/file)
- 500 files: TBD seconds (TBD ms/file)
- 1000 files: TBD seconds (TBD ms/file)

**Current:**
- Not yet measured

**Target:**
- 1000 files: <5 minutes (300 seconds, 300 ms/file)

**Incremental Processing (new feature):**
- Target: 10x faster for daily incremental updates

### ML Integration Status
- ‚úÖ **ThresholdOptimizer**: Wired to sigma_analyzer (2025-01-25)
- ‚è∏Ô∏è **FailurePredictor**: Not wired (Phase 3)
- ‚è∏Ô∏è **DriftDetector**: Not wired (Phase 3)

### Test Coverage
- **Total Tests**: 53
- **Passing**: 53/53 (100%)
- **Added During Refactor**: 0
- **Target**: 75+ (add regression tests)

## Recent Activity

### 2025-01-25 - Project Setup
- Created REFACTORING directory structure
- Created all tracking files
- Established project rules and protocols
- Ready to begin Phase 1

---

## Completed Milestones

**Setup Phase (2025-01-25)**:
- [x] Directory structure created
- [x] Tracking files created
- [x] Session protocol defined
- [x] Refactoring rules documented
- [x] Todo system initialized

---

## Next Steps

1. **Establish baseline** (Phase 1, Day 1)
   - Run comprehensive test suite
   - Benchmark performance (100/500/1000 files)
   - Document current architecture

2. **Begin Phase 1** (Week 1)
   - Implement incremental processing
   - Remove dead code
   - Analyze processor chaos

---

## Session Summary

**Total Sessions**: 0
**Total Hours**: 0
**Productivity**: N/A (not started)

**Latest Session**: [None yet]

---

## Notes

- Refactoring officially begins with Phase 1, Day 1
- All tracking systems in place
- Following strict protocols from SESSION_PROTOCOL.md
- All rules from CLAUDE_REFACTOR_RULES.md apply
