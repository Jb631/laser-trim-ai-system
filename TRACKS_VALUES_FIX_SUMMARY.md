# Fix for 'InstrumentedList' object has no attribute 'values' Error

## Problem
The application was throwing an error: `'InstrumentedList' object has no attribute 'values'` when trying to display database results in the GUI.

## Root Cause
The code was treating `result.tracks` as a dictionary and calling `.values()` on it. However:
- When results come from **analysis** (in-memory), `tracks` is a **dictionary** with track IDs as keys
- When results come from **database** (SQLAlchemy), `tracks` is a **list** (InstrumentedList) due to the SQLAlchemy relationship

## Files Fixed

### 1. `/src/laser_trim_analyzer/gui/pages/batch_processing_page.py` (Line 1842)
**Before:**
```python
for track in result.tracks.values():
```

**After:**
```python
# Handle both dict (from analysis) and list (from DB) formats
if isinstance(result.tracks, dict):
    track_count = len(result.tracks)
    tracks_iter = result.tracks.values()
else:
    track_count = len(result.tracks)
    tracks_iter = result.tracks
    
for track in tracks_iter:
```

### 2. `/src/laser_trim_analyzer/gui/widgets/batch_results_widget_ctk.py` (Line 117)
**Before:**
```python
for track in result.tracks.values():
```

**After:**
```python
# Handle both dict (from analysis) and list (from DB) formats
if isinstance(result.tracks, dict):
    track_count = len(result.tracks)
    tracks_iter = result.tracks.values()
else:
    track_count = len(result.tracks)
    tracks_iter = result.tracks
    
for track in tracks_iter:
```

## Additional Improvements
Both fixes also now properly handle the different status field names:
- Analysis results: `track.overall_status`
- Database results: `track.status`

## Testing
To verify the fix works:
1. Load the application
2. Navigate to the Batch Processing page
3. Load results from database (if any exist)
4. The error should no longer occur

## Prevention
For future development, always check the type of `tracks` before accessing:
```python
if isinstance(result.tracks, dict):
    # Analysis result - use .values()
    for track in result.tracks.values():
        pass
else:
    # Database result - iterate directly
    for track in result.tracks:
        pass
```
