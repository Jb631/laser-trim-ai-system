## 1. Root Cause Analysis

### 1.1 Critical Security Issues

#### **RCA-SEC-001: Pickle Deserialization Vulnerability**
- **Root Cause:** Developer convenience prioritized over security
- **Systemic Issue:** Lack of security review in code review process
- **Architectural Impact:** Requires cache layer redesign
- **Contributing Factors:**
  - No security guidelines for serialization
  - Missing SAST (Static Application Security Testing) in CI/CD
  - Performance optimization without security consideration

#### **RCA-SEC-002: No Authentication System**
- **Root Cause:** Application started as internal tool, grew without security layer
- **Systemic Issue:** Missing security-first design principles
- **Architectural Impact:** Major - requires auth layer across all components
- **Contributing Factors:**
  - Incremental feature growth without architecture review
  - No clear user access requirements defined
  - Desktop application mindset vs. enterprise requirements

#### **RCA-SEC-003: SSL/TLS Validation Disabled**
- **Root Cause:** Development convenience (self-signed certs) became production code

- **Architectural Impact:** Minor - configuration change required
- **Contributing Factors:**
  - Missing environment-specific configurations
  - No security checklist for external communications

### 1.2 Data Integrity Issues

  - Rapid ML development without version control
  - No model registry or validation
  - Missing backward compatibility requirements

### 1.3 Performance Issues

#### **RCA-PERF-001: Memory Exhaustion with Large Files**
- **Root Cause:** Entire file loaded into memory for processing
- **Systemic Issue:** Scalability not considered in initial design
- **Architectural Impact:** Major - requires streaming architecture
- **Contributing Factors:**
  - Prototype code became production code
  - No memory profiling in testing
  - Excel library limitations not evaluated

#### **RCA-PERF-002: UI Thread Blocking**
- **Root Cause:** Synchronous operations on main thread
- **Systemic Issue:** GUI responsiveness not prioritized
- **Architectural Impact:** Medium - requires async refactoring
- **Contributing Factors:**
  - Limited async/await usage
  - No UI performance testing
  - Complex operations not offloaded to workers

#### **RCA-PERF-003: Matplotlib Memory Leaks**
- **Root Cause:** Figures not properly closed after use
- **Systemic Issue:** Resource cleanup not systematic
- **Architectural Impact:** Low - requires cleanup procedures
- **Contributing Factors:**
  - Missing resource management patterns
