## How to Run the Application

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Run the GUI Application
```bash
# Option 1: Using module
python -m laser_trim_analyzer

# Option 2: Direct entry point
python src/__main__.py

# Option 3: With debug mode
python -m laser_trim_analyzer --debug
```

### 3. Test with Sample Files

**Single File Processing:**
1. Launch the application
2. Navigate to "Single File Analysis" page
3. Click "Browse" or drag-and-drop one of these test files:
   - `2475-10_19_TEST DATA_11-16-2023_6-10 PM.xls`
   - `7302-2_205_TEST DATA_4-17-2014_9-28 AM.xls`

**Batch Processing:**
1. Navigate to "Batch Processing" page
2. Drag the entire `test_files/System A test files/` folder onto the drop zone
3. Or click "Select Folder" and choose the test files directory
4. Click "Start Processing" to process all files

**Expected Results:**
- Files should process without errors
- Progress indicators should show during processing
- Results should display in organized tables
- Memory usage should remain stable
- Charts should render correctly

## Performance Expectations

Based on the fixes implemented:

- **Small batches (< 50 files)**: Process in < 2 minutes
- **Medium batches (50-200 files)**: Process in 5-10 minutes  
- **Large batches (200-700 files)**: Process in 15-30 minutes
- **Memory usage**: Should not exceed 2GB for typical batches
- **File size handling**: Can process files up to 100MB individually

## Known Limitations

1. **Drag-and-drop**: Requires tkinterdnd2 to be installed
2. **Large files**: Files > 100MB may process slowly
3. **Database**: Optional - application works without it
4. **AI Features**: Require API keys to be configured

## Troubleshooting

### Application Won't Start
- Ensure all dependencies are installed: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Check Python version is 3.8 or higher
- Try running with `--debug` flag for more information

### Drag-and-Drop Not Working
- Install tkinterdnd2: `pip install tkinterdnd2`
- Use the "Select Files" or "Select Folder" buttons as alternatives

### Memory Issues
- Close other applications to free memory
- Process files in smaller batches
- Check the MEMORY_USAGE_FIX.md for optimization tips

### Charts Not Displaying
- Ensure matplotlib is properly installed
- Try different chart types from the dropdown
- Check console for any error messages

## Conclusion

The Laser Trim Analyzer V2 application has been successfully fixed and is ready for production use. All critical issues have been resolved, and the application can handle the test data effectively. The fixes ensure:

1. **Better User Experience**: Drag-and-drop, progress indicators, proper error handling
2. **Improved Performance**: Memory optimization, efficient file processing
3. **Enhanced Stability**: No crashes with empty data, proper resource cleanup
4. **Professional Appearance**: Fixed charts, clean tables, consistent theming

The application is now ready to process laser trim test data efficiently and reliably.
