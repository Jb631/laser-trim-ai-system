# Cleanup Summary - June 8, 2025

## Overview
This cleanup removed unused files and organized the project structure. Approximately 7,500 lines of unused code were archived.

## Files Moved to Archive

### 1. Orphaned Python Modules (15 files)
These modules were never imported by any other file in the codebase:

#### Alternative Architecture
- `core/session_manager.py` (never imported)

NOTE: Initially moved interfaces.py, implementations.py, and strategies.py but restored them as they are actively used.

#### Standalone Scripts
- `api/ai_analysis.py` - AI-powered QA analysis tool
- `core/cache_integration.py` - Cache usage examples
- `utils/optimize_imports_cli.py` - Import optimization CLI tool

#### Unused Progress System
- `gui/progress_system.py`
- `gui/progress_integration.py`
- `gui/async_handler.py`

#### Qt-based Widgets (project uses CustomTkinter)
- `gui/widgets/qt_progress_widgets.py`

#### Unused Performance Tools
- `database/performance_optimizer.py`
- `utils/performance_monitor.py`
- `utils/import_optimizer.py`
- `utils/lazy_imports.py`
- `utils/README_IMPORT_TOOLS.md`

### 2. Misplaced Test Scripts (8 files)
Test scripts that were in wrong locations:

#### From src/ directory
- `test_excel_processing.py`
- `test_gui_startup.py`
- `test_single_file.py`
- `test_validation_grades.py`

#### From root directory
- `test_import_sequence.py`
- `test_sqlalchemy_import.py`
- `test_tracks_fix.py`
- `test_ui_fixes.py`

### 3. Generated Files
- `dependency_report.json`
- `DEPENDENCY_ANALYSIS_REPORT.md`
- `excel_processing_test.log`
- `gui_startup_test.log`

### 4. Build Artifacts Removed
- `src/ai_cache/` (duplicate cache)
- `src/laser_trim_analyzer.egg-info/`
- All `__pycache__` directories

## Recommendations

1. **Future Orphaned Code**: Consider implementing CI checks to detect unused code
2. **Test Organization**: All tests should be in the `tests/` directory
3. **Archive Management**: Consider consolidating older archives
4. **Documentation**: Update development docs to reflect removed tools

## Space Saved
- Archive size: ~1.5MB
- Removed cache/build artifacts: ~500KB
- Total cleanup: ~2MB

## No Impact on Functionality
All removed files were verified to be unused by the main application. The cleanup reduces code complexity without affecting any features.
