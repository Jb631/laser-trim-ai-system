Development Roadmap for Building AI-Powered QA System via Chat Sessions

This roadmap shows how to build a complete system through focused chat sessions,
each producing working code that builds on the previous session.

# CONTINUITY STRATEGY - How to maintain context

CONTINUITY_PLAN = """
1. START EACH SESSION WITH:
   - Brief summary of what's built so far
   - Current project structure
   - Specific module to work on today
   - Any issues from testing

2. USE THIS PROMPT TEMPLATE:
   'I'm building an AI-powered QA system for potentiometer testing. 
   So far I have: [list modules]. 
   Today I need to build: [specific module].
   Here's my current project structure: [paste structure]
   Issues to address: [list any problems]'

3. SAVE THESE ARTIFACTS:
   - Project structure diagram
   - Module interaction diagram  
   - Configuration files
   - Test results

4. CREATE A MASTER DOCUMENT:
   - Track all sessions
   - List completed modules
   - Note dependencies
   - Record test results

# SMART PRACTICES FOR CHAT DEVELOPMENT

BEST_PRACTICES = {
    "1. Modular Design": {
        "why": "Each module works independently",
        "how": "Use clear interfaces between modules",
        "benefit": "Can develop/test in isolation"
    },

    "2. Progressive Enhancement": {
        "why": "Start simple, add features gradually",
        "how": "Basic version first, then enhance",
        "benefit": "Always have working software"
    },

    "3. Test Harnesses": {
        "why": "Verify each module works correctly",
        "how": "Include test data and scripts",
        "benefit": "Catch issues early"
    },

    "4. Documentation": {
        "why": "Remember decisions between sessions",
        "how": "Comment code thoroughly",
        "benefit": "Easy to resume development"
    },

    "5. Version Control": {
        "why": "Track changes and progress",
        "how": "Git commit after each session",
        "benefit": "Can rollback if needed"
    }
}

3. START FIRST SESSION:
   'Let's build the core data pipeline for my laser trim AI system.
   I need to load Excel files, validate data, and calculate sigma gradients.'

4. AFTER EACH SESSION:
   - Save all code
   - Test with real data
