# Archive Summary - CTK Migration Cleanup

**Date**: 2025-06-08
**Purpose**: Archive obsolete non-CTK files after migration to CustomTkinter

## Files Archived

### 1. metric_card.py
- **Location**: `src/laser_trim_analyzer/gui/widgets/metric_card.py`
- **Reason**: Obsolete - all code now uses `metric_card_ctk.py`
- **Changes Made Before Archiving**:
  - Updated `widgets/__init__.py` to import from `metric_card_ctk.py`
  - Verified all pages already use the CTK version

### 2. batch_results_widget.py
- **Location**: `src/laser_trim_analyzer/gui/widgets/batch_results_widget.py`
- **Reason**: Obsolete - migrated to `batch_results_widget_ctk.py`
- **Changes Made Before Archiving**:
  - Removed try/except fallback pattern in `batch_processing_page.py`
  - Updated `widgets/__init__.py` to import from `batch_results_widget_ctk.py`

### 3. progress_widgets.py
- **Location**: `src/laser_trim_analyzer/gui/widgets/progress_widgets.py`
- **Reason**: Obsolete - migrated to `progress_widgets_ctk.py`
- **Changes Made Before Archiving**:
  - Removed try/except fallback pattern in `batch_processing_page.py`
  - Updated `widgets/__init__.py` to import from `progress_widgets_ctk.py`
  - Updated `single_file_page.py` to import from `progress_widgets_ctk.py`

## Files Kept (Not Archived)

### 1. main_window.py
- **Reason**: Acts as a bridge/wrapper for `ctk_main_window.py`
- **Status**: Intentional design pattern for backward compatibility

### 2. batch_results_widget.py
- **Reason**: Used as fallback in try/except pattern
- **Status**: Keep until full CTK migration is complete

### 3. progress_widgets.py
- **Reason**: Used as fallback in try/except pattern
- **Status**: Keep until full CTK migration is complete

## Migration Status

The CTK migration is now COMPLETE. All fallback patterns have been removed.

Current state:
- ✅ MetricCard - Fully migrated to CTK (archived)
- ✅ BatchResultsWidget - Fully migrated to CTK (archived)
- ✅ ProgressWidgets - Fully migrated to CTK (archived)
- ✅ MainWindow - Bridge pattern working as designed (kept)
- ✅ BasePage - CTK-only (no regular version exists)

## Changes Made During Migration

1. **Removed all try/except fallback patterns**
   - `batch_processing_page.py` - Now imports CTK versions directly
   - No more conditional imports based on availability

2. **Updated all imports to CTK versions**
   - `widgets/__init__.py` - Exports CTK versions
   - `single_file_page.py` - Uses CTK ProgressDialog
   - `batch_processing_page.py` - Uses CTK widgets

3. **Archived obsolete files**
   - `metric_card.py`
   - `batch_results_widget.py`
   - `progress_widgets.py`

## Final State

The application now exclusively uses CustomTkinter (CTK) widgets. The only non-CTK file remaining is `main_window.py`, which serves as an intentional bridge/wrapper for backward compatibility.
