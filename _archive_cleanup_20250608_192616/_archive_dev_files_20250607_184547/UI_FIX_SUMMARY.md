# Single File Page UI Fix Summary

## Issue
The single file page had duplicate windows stacked on top of each other when displaying analysis results.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by:
1. The `empty_state_frame` was never hidden when results were displayed
2. The `analysis_display` widget was initially hidden with `pack_forget()` but was never shown again
3. This caused both frames to be visible at the same time, creating a stacked/duplicate window appearance

## Fix Applied

### 1. Updated `_handle_analysis_success` method (line 683-688)
```python
# Before:
# Display results
try:
    self.analysis_display.display_result(result)
except Exception as e:
    logger.error(f"Failed to display analysis result: {e}")
    # Continue with other operations even if display fails

# After:
# Display results
try:
    # Hide empty state and show analysis display
    self.empty_state_frame.pack_forget()
    self.analysis_display.pack(fill='both', expand=True, padx=15, pady=(0, 15))
    self.analysis_display.display_result(result)
except Exception as e:
    logger.error(f"Failed to display analysis result: {e}")
    # Continue with other operations even if display fails
```

### 2. Updated `_clear_results` method (line 972-991)
```python
# Added these lines to properly toggle between empty state and results:
# Hide analysis display and show empty state
self.analysis_display.pack_forget()
self.empty_state_frame.pack(fill='both', expand=True, padx=15, pady=(0, 15))
```

## How It Works Now

1. **Initial State**: Empty state frame is shown, analysis display is hidden
2. **When Analysis Completes**: Empty state is hidden, analysis display is shown
3. **When Clear is Clicked**: Analysis display is hidden, empty state is shown

This ensures only one frame is visible at a time, preventing the duplicate window issue.
